Be a Fighter
A young friend of mine asked me in a letter, "What kind of man should I be?" My answer was, "Be a fighter."

Another friend of mine inquired, "How should I live my life?" Again my answer was, "Be a fighter."

The author of In Praise of the Fighter says:

A fighter will never lose heart or despair. He will pile up broken pieces of brick and stone to rebuild a nine-story pagoda on the ruins of failure. No blows will ever break his will. He will never close his eyes until he has breathed his las
