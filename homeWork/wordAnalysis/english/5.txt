Students at a university in East China’s Anhui province will probably not receive their diploma if they fail a physical fitness test, a type of test that requires students to achieve long-distance running, standing long jump, etc. The test has stirred much debate on social media regarding whether the university’s physical education should be a requirment of their academic degree.
The decision was announced by Zhang Xiang, head of Anqing Normal University, during a recent university’s sports committee meeting, to encourage students to do more exercises after class, according to Xin’an Evening News, a local newspaper in Anhui province.
According to Zhang, the new regulation will come into force in 2019 and graduates who fail to pass the fitness tests will not be given a bachelor degree in June next year.
However, it is not a one-time test like gaokao, China’s college entrance examination. Students who fail the tests before graduation will be offered another chance to retake the test, and if they fail it again, they will have to retake the test after graduation. Unfortunately, graduates who fail to pass the tests will not get a bachelor degree.
