(CNN) — British Prime Minister Theresa May will condemn the prospect of a second Brexit referendum in an address to Parliament Monday, as pressure for a new vote grows both inside and outside a bitterly divided Westminster.
"Let us not break faith with the British people by trying to stage another referendum," May will say, according to prepared remarks.
"Another vote... would do irreparable damage to the integrity of our politics, because it would say to millions who trusted in democracy that our democracy does not deliver."
Her speech will follow a report that some in May’s Conservative Party are laying the groundwork for another referendum, believing it is the only way to break the impasse over the Prime Minister’s Brexit bill.
Promises that May could secure more guarantees and compromises from the European Union fell flat in Brussels, where she was once again humiliated.
