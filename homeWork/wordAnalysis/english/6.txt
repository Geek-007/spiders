US president’s son says he once received back a monogrammed item he had given as a present.
Donald Trump’s eldest son has said the US president is a “regifter” who once gave him the same gift he had presented to his father the year before.
Donald Trump Jr said in an interview with the US entertainment programme Extra that because he is his father’s namesake, he “got regifted all the things that were monogrammed for him at times”.
He also said he had challenged his father about the issue one Christmas, explaining that he was the one who had given him the monogrammed item he then received back.
Trump Jr also said he would be spending the Christmas holidays with his family and his girlfriend Kimberly Guilfoyle at the president’s Mar-a-Lago club in Florida.
“It would be a wonderful thing” if he could tweet his father’s holiday dinner commentary, he said.
